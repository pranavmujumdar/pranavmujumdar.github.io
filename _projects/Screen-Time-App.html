    <h1 class=",bg-primary" id="title">Digital Discipline, curb the procrastinator in you!</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">
        How do we help people get disciplined digitally? </br>Make their day distraction free and keep them motivated
    </h2>
    <h2 class="DarkBlue">
        Problem Statement
    </h2>
    <p>Almost everyone carries a smartphone these days, when used as a tool, it increases our productivity and makes our lives easier, we can keep work organized, keep us in touch with our loved ones. <em>However</em> with the rise of social media and our constant need to be updated with what's happening around the world, adversely affects our productivity and most often than not we become addicted to our phones and the social media apps keep distracting us </p>
    <em>With hopes of finding specifics of this issue and finding the right demographic for the application I started having virtual interviews to understand what the daily habits of the users are and what effect does smartphones have on their life</em>
    
    <h2 class="DarkBlue" >User Interviews and Empathy Maps</h2>
    <p>Based on the initial interviews I had with 8 users, I created a three empathy maps that represent the users that have similar problems in their daily routine </p>
    <h4 class="DarkBlue">Users overindulge in their phones</h4>
    <p>Multiple users over-indulged in social media, they feel the constant urge to check their phones for notifications, and they feel the need to check every notification and get distracted by it</p>

    {% include elements/carousel.html %} <!-- Carousel for User type 1 -->
    <h4 class="theRed">Important Pain Points from these users</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>    
            They certainly try to avoid the overindulgence but they end up <span class="text-primary"><em>falling off the wagon</em></span> after a few weeks as the motivation fades away
        </li>
        <li>
            They constantly get notified of activities on social media applications, distracts them from their work 
        </li>
        <li>
            They often check certain apps like YouTube and Instagram and night and causes them to lose sleep, affecting the next day
        </li>
        <li>
            Their eyes hurt due to use at night, sometimes the next day headache due to lack of sleep
        </li>
        <li>
            They would definitely like to have control on their kids' devices
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="theRed">Sketching and Low Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
    <p>With the Pain points isolated, I started the sketching ideas and screens for a few features that would help solve them</p>

      <p>To understand if the application is easily usable, conducted 8 usability tests using  <a href="https://maze.design">maze</a> which made usability testing quite easy</p>

      <h4 class="text-success">Task completion rate was 100%</h4>
      <p>All the tasks were performed by the users, some users did take time longer than expected to complete a few tasks, for example, finding a way to create a customized mode</p>
      <h3 class="theRed">What did the users say?</h3>
      <h5>"The way it gives me the ability to collectively manage my use for a category of apps is useful"</h5>
      <h5>"If I could get a free coffee, just for not wasting time on my phone, I'd like that!"</h5>
      <h5>"This is definitely something that people would use just to get offers around"</h5>
      <h5>"The reward feature can be explored more in alignment with the parental control, if the kid avoids excessive usage parent could get notified to treat them for being a good kid"</h5>
      <h5>"The red in the colour palette gives a feeling of warning and better colour selection can be made"</h5>
      <h3 class="text-primary" style="padding-top: 1rem;">Further Enhancements and future scope</h3>
      <ul>
            <li>
                Custom Designed Iconography and better suited colour palette can be selected to make the application more appealing
            </li>
            <li>    
                A form of virtual currency and awards can be given to the users who follow their discipline, that will trigger the dopamine release and keep users motivated 
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiple users, when asked, had no problem making a brief overview of their daily usage visible to their "friends", given that they have the control over what is shared
            </li>
      </ul>
