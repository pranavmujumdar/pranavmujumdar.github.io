# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a Software Engineer, with more inclination towards design, I would spend my days writing code, however as the sun sets you'll find me sketching and playing guitar. I code for Web Dev on MEAN and MERN and for Game dev. I like to fiddle with Reinforcement learning by simulating real world scenarios. I also write in an attempt to assign a value to the null variable inside me.
